ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND BIAS ANALYSIS
=======================================

1. DATA BIAS CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Historical bias: The model learns from past match data, which may reflect
     historical advantages or disadvantages of certain teams or leagues
   - Temporal bias: Older data may not reflect current team performance
   - Geographic bias: Some leagues or regions may be over/under-represented

2. FAIRNESS CONCERNS:
   - Team fairness: The model should not systematically favor certain teams
   - League fairness: Performance should be consistent across different leagues
   - Venue fairness: Home advantage should be modeled appropriately, not amplified

3. POTENTIAL MISUSE:
   - Gambling: This model should not be used for betting or gambling purposes
   - Match fixing: Predictions should not influence actual match outcomes
   - Financial decisions: Should not be used for significant financial investments

4. TRANSPARENCY:
   - Feature importance is provided to understand model decisions
   - Model limitations are clearly documented
   - Uncertainty in predictions is acknowledged

5. RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - Regular model retraining with recent data
   - Monitoring for bias in predictions across different groups
   - Clear communication of model limitations to end users
   - Responsible deployment with appropriate safeguards
